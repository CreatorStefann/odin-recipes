    <h2>
        A taco salad is basically a deconstructed taco served in a bowl. If you want to re-create a Mexican restaurant
        experience, serve this salad in a crispy Tortilla Taco Salad Shell for a fun twist.
    </h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 Tortilla Taco Salad Bowls, optional</li>
        <li> 1 lb lean ground beef, 90/10</li>
        <li> 3 Tbsp Taco Seasoning, or 1 packet</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup water </li>
        <li> 1 iceberg lettuce, medium head, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 avocado, peeled, pitted and sliced</li>
        <li> 1 cup pico de gallo, or to taste</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend, or to taste</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup tortilla strips or chips </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li> 1 lime, cut into wedges to serve, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make Crispy Tortilla Bowls if using. While they bake and cool, proceed with the recipe.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, brown your beef. When there is no pink left on the meat, spoon out all
            of the excess fat then add taco seasoning and 1/2 cup water. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-5 minutes.
            Remove from heat and cool until itâ€™s lightly warm or room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, add the dressing ingredients and stir to combine. Refrigerate and let the
            flavors meld while you prepare your toppings.</li>
        <li>Chop lettuce and place into serving bowls (serves 6 as a side salad or 4 as a main course). Divide ground
            beef between the bowls over the lettuce.</li>
        <li>Add remaining toppings as desired then garnish with cilantro drizzle with the dressing and serve with lime
            wedges to squeeze over the salad.</li>
    </ol>
